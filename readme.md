# Overview

* Adds a combinator that outputs the color of the biome where it is built
* Color is provided as component Red, Green, and Blue signals
* Signal values are updated when the combinator is built, and every time the GUI is opened
* Biome color is based on the map color of the dominant tile in a small radius around the combinator
